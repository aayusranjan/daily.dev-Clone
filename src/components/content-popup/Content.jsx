        It’s nearly the end of 2018, and you think you might finally be ready to
        get started learning ReactJS. You hear the hype and you know it’s become
        the most popular front end JavaScript framework. You sit down at your
        computer, crack your knuckles, and are ready to give it a go. Starting
        off, you probably jump straight in with Facebook’s official React
        tutorial. After that maybe another tutorial on medium. You do some
        reading here and there, and if you are like me, you end up pretty
        confused. You hear terms like “props”, “state”, “virtual dom”, “ES6”,
        “babel”, “webpack”, “higher-order components”, “Redux”, and much more.
        Soon you realize that learning React is not as easy as you once imagined
        and either quit or confusedly persevere on. Does this sound like you?
        Because this is exactly how I felt when I started learning React. All I
        wanted to do was set up a simple React app, and I was getting very
        confused and sometimes frustrated. I thought React had a fairly
        difficult learning curve, and I was feeling pretty overwhelmed. I soon
        realized that React was fairly easy to learn, but the way I went about
        learning it was difficult. The problem was I didn’t know how to learn
        it. Firstly, I was relatively new to the world of front end development
        and I didn’t know what I was doing. I was somewhat familiar with HTML
        and only used JavaScript a few times. That certainly did not help. There
        were technologies and information that I should have spent a little more
        time learning prior to React, that would have lowered the learning curve
        tremendously.
